# Nouri Intellectual Property Policy

Nouri (“Nouri” or the “Organization”) is dedicated to eliminating childhood hunger by assisting families in need of food by connecting them with providers of food. Nouri will accomplish this mission through offering a modern, technology driven approach to solving the problem of childhood hunger. Our program centers around the operation of a mobile and web based platform for facilitating relationships between public charities and non-profit organizations focused on preventing and ending childhood hunger, meal preparation services, restaurants, grocers, and food delivery services, and most importantly, families in need and demonstrating poverty and inability to access food at normal market prices. In order to do this we anticipate creating intellectual property. Nouri firmly believes in encouraging its staff and volunteers to produce new creative works, ideas, and applications, some of which may have commercial value.

These activities contribute to the services we provide, professional development of the individuals involved, enhance the reputation of Nouri, and promote the public welfare. Intellectual property created by Nouri employees or with the use of Nouri resources should be appropriately managed in the best interest of the public we intend to aid and Nouri. This policy addresses ownership rights and revenue sharing for intellectual property created by Nouri employees/volunteers or created with the significant use of Nouri resources.

Compliance with this policy is required for all Nouri employees as part of the terms of their employment. This policy also applies to Organization non-employees, such as volunteers, that create intellectual property with significant use of the Organization’s resources. 

## Ownership of Intellectual Property.

Ownership by NOURI: Nouri claims ownership of intellectual property in each of the following categories:
(1) Any intellectual property created by a Nouri or Board employee in the course and scope of employment, and 
(2) Any intellectual property created with the significant use of NOURI resources, unless otherwise provided in an authorized agreement for the use of those resources.

However, Nouri’s claim to ownership may be altered by:
(1) Exceptions described in this policy,
(2) Applicable law, or
(3) Written agreement signed by an authorized Nouri representative.

All employees and others creating intellectual property in the course and scope of employment are required to assign (and do assign) to Nouri all rights in intellectual property in which Nouri claims an ownership interest under this policy. In addition, all employees and others creating intellectual property (including volunteers) with a significant use of Nouri resources are required to assign (and do assign) to the Board all rights in intellectual property in which the Board claims an ownership interest under this Policy.

The Board of Directors shall exercise Nouri’s intellectual property rights. Subject to the Bylaws, the Board may create a subcommittee to manage these rights in lieu of the full Board. Further, the Board may delegate the responsibility for management to an officer level position by assigning the duty to an existing officer position through a written resolution or the creation of a new officer position. As used below, the term “IP Manager” refers to the individual or body charged with management of Nouri’s intellectual property rights.

Nouri does not make any claim of copyright ownership of the following works of authorship:

a. Purely academic works;
b. Works of fine art (e.g., music, art, dance, film), unless specifically commissioned by Nouri; and
c. Volunteer-created works that have not used significant Nouri resources.

To the extent applicable law would result in Board ownership of these works, upon written request by the creator(s) to Nouri’s IP Manager, the Board will assign the applicable rights to the creator(s) of such works, subject to the following:

(1) Retention by the Board of a paid-up royalty-free, nonexclusive license, for the full term of the intellectual property rights, to use for non-commercial purposes these works of authorship for education, research, and the furtherance of the public service mission of Nouri. In very limited circumstances in which the IP Manager determines that retention of these rights is unnecessary to Nouri’s goals in supporting education, research, and the furtherance of the public service of Nouri, the IP Manager may waive this requirement; and

(2) Agreement by the creator not to use the Board’s or Nouri’s name in any commercial context involving the works other than to identify Nouri employee’s position with the NOURI.

Transfer of Nouri -owned intellectual property through licensing or assignment.
a. Subject to applicable law, Nouri may transfer rights in or title to its intellectual property through agreements signed by authorized Nouri or Board representatives or signed on behalf of the Board by a contracted third party (including but not limited to an intellectual property management organization). Transfer of intellectual property to Nouri officers, board members, or employees is also subject to disclosure and conflict of interest policy requirements.

Any agreement to assign, license or otherwise transfer any Board-owned intellectual property rights is subject to the following conditions:

(1) Nouri’s IP Manager must either review the agreement before it is signed or may approve the procedure pursuant to which the agreement is reviewed and signed.
(2) The IP Manager will use reasonable efforts under the circumstances to consult with the creator(s) who are then employed by Nouri during the negotiation process. The IP Manager will provide creator(s) of the intellectual property who are then employed by Nouri with a copy of the negotiated agreement prior to its final execution. If any creator then employed by Nouri does not agree with the negotiated terms, he or she may appeal the IP Manager's position before the agreement is executed, in accordance with this policy, following the process and time limits established by each Nouri.

## Revenue Sharing

Nouri will not share revenue with employees that have created intellectual property owned by Nouri. However, the creation of intellectual property having commercial value and the generation of revenue for Nouri through the licensing, assignment, or sale of such intellectual property will be a factor for consideration in determination of an employee’s eligibility for a bonus.

Outside Consulting and Intellectual Property Development “Off the Clock”

Employees and officers are encouraged to work with and consult for outside organizations. Employees will hold all intellectual property rights to intellectual property developed with or for outside organizations (including the employee itself) if intellectual property falls outside of the employee’s scope of work AND is created without use of any Nouri resources. If the employee's obligations under this policy conflict with the employee's obligations to the outside organization, the obligations under this policy will prevail.

An employee may not transfer, by assignment or otherwise, intellectual property owned by the board through a consulting or other agreement with a third party unless authorized in writing by the IP Manager. Any purported transfer in violation of this paragraph shall be void and unenforceable.

## Administrative Responsibilities

1. Responsibilities of the creator(s) of intellectual property:

Each employee (including visiting faculty, researchers, and scientists) must promptly and fully disclose in writing to the IP Manager any intellectual property made by that person, or resulting from work carried on under his/her direction, in which NOURI may have an interest. Nouri will adopt a disclosure form and make the forms readily available to employees and others who may use Nouri resources.

Intellectual property created as a result of outside consulting must be disclosed to Nouri if the intellectual property would fall within Article I of this policy, or as required by other Nouri or Board policies or applicable laws.

Intellectual property created prior to an employee’s start date with Nouri must be disclosed to Nouri on a disclosure form within 1 week of such employee’s start date.

The creator must cooperate fully with Nouri with respect to technology transfer and commercialization activities relating to intellectual property. In addition, the creator shall execute all documentation necessary for the Board to establish, confirm, or perfect its ownership interest in intellectual property, including documentation necessary to assign ownership to the Board for recordation or other purposes, and, if necessary, to secure protection of intellectual property owned by the Board in those countries designated by Nouri IP Manager.

The creator must comply with all applicable laws and Nouri and Board policies relating to conflicts of interest.

2. Responsibilities of the IP Manager. 

The IP Manager will administer all intellectual property owned by the board in accordance with the requirements of this policy and applicable law, and may exercise discretion in deciding among the following options:

a. The IP Manager may permit an employee to use Nouri information of minimal value on its on, such as notes from a group workshop, to develop intellectual property to be owned solely by the employee. However, the employee may not use such materials unless and until the employee has received written authorization from the IP Manager. The IP Manager shall not grant any authorization if the IP Manager determines that the requested use actually entails use of significant resources or otherwise violates this intellectual property policy.

b. Intellectual property may be licensed, assigned, or sold to the creator if the IP Manager determines within a reasonable time that after reviewing the circumstance of an individual case the interests of the Board are better served by releasing ownership to the creator under conditions to be specified by Nouri to include, but not be limited to the following:

(1) The Board retains a paid-up, non-exclusive license to use this intellectual property for education, research, and in furtherance of the public service mission of Nouri;
(2) Provision for a minimal royalty or other consideration to Nouri in the event of commercialization of the intellectual property; and
(3) The creator may not use Nouri facilities to improve upon the intellectual property. If the creator wishes to continue work on the intellectual property using Nouri managed funds and/or facilities, he/she will need to do so under an arm's length relationship or may reassign his/her rights to Nouri.

c. Intellectual property may be licensed or assigned to one or more intellectual property management organizations for commercial development;

d. Intellectual property may be licensed, assigned, sold or optioned to a third party;

e. Intellectual property may be patented, or otherwise protected, by Nouri, appropriately marketed, and either licensed or assigned to another organization for commercialization;

f. Intellectual property may be archived by Nouri; or

g. Intellectual property may be released or dedicated by Nouri to the public domain.
